Description: Fit penalized splines mixed-effects models (a special case of additive models) for large longitudinal datasets. The package includes a psme() function that (1) relies on package 'mgcv' for constructing population and subject smooth functions as penalized splines, (2) transforms the constructed additive model to a linear mixed-effects model, (3) exploits package 'lme4' for model estimation and (4) backtransforms the estimated linear mixed-effects model to the additive model for interpretation and visualizaiton. See Pedersen et al. (2019) <doi:10.7717/peerj.6876> and Bates et al. (2015) <doi:10.18637/jss.v067.i01> for an introduction. Unlike the gamm() function in 'mgcv', the psme() function is fast and memory-efficient, able to handle datasets with millions of observations.
